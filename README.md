# No Man's Sky Community Mission Progress viewer

[![Supported by the No Man's Sky Community Developers & Designers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NMSCD/About/master/badge/purple-ftb.svg)][nmscd]

This website allows you to look through the data collected by [AssistantNMS][assistantnmsWebsite] since the 16th of March.

## Build and Test
This solution is a React project using Vite. 
1. Install dependencies with `npm i`
2. Run locally with `npm run dev`
   1. The API requests to **api.nmsassistant.com** will most likely fail due to CORS. I would suggest using a browser extension like [this one](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf)

## Contribute
We are open to [Forks](https://github.com/NMSCD/CommunityMission-Progress-Viewer/fork) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/NMSCD/CommunityMission-Progress-Viewer/pulls). There is currently no contribution guideline and so there is no guarantee that any issues logged will be fixed or any pull requests that have been submitted getting merged. 

This is a fun little tool built for the community using data recorded by [AssistantNMS][assistantnmsWebsite] which also allows for the NMS community to pull data.
